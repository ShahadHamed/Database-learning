Comparison Between Flat File Systems and Relational Databases

1. Structure

Flat File Systems

Store data in a single file or simple files like TXT, CSV, or spreadsheets.

Data is arranged in lines or rows without enforced structure.

No concept of tables, schemas, or data types.

All information is kept together, making the format simple but limited.

Relational Databases

Organize data into multiple structured tables with rows and columns.

Each table has a defined schema (data types, constraints, rules).

Support indexing, keys, and efficient data retrieval.

Provide a well-organized and controlled environment for storing complex datasets.

2. Data Redundancy

Flat File Systems

High redundancy because the same data must be repeated in multiple entries.

Leads to larger file sizes and more storage usage.

Increases risk of inconsistent data when updates are not applied everywhere.

Relational Databases

Low redundancy due to normalization (splitting data into related tables).

Shared data is stored once and referenced using keys.

Easier to maintain accuracy and consistency across the system.

3. Relationships

Flat File Systems

Cannot naturally represent complex relationships between data.

All data is stored linearly, making linking records difficult.

Relationships must be manually managed, increasing errors.

Relational Databases

Designed to handle relationships using primary keys and foreign keys.

Support one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.

Maintain data integrity automatically through constraints.

4. Example Usage

Flat File Systems

Used for small or simple datasets.

Common in configuration files, logs, simple contact lists, and basic data exchange.

Suitable when the dataset does not require complex queries.

Relational Databases

Used in large, structured, and multi-user applications.

Examples: hospital systems, banking systems, e-commerce platforms, reservation systems.

Ideal for environments requiring high accuracy, quick searches, and secure storage.

5. Drawbacks

Flat File Systems

Difficult to manage as data grows.

Lack security, access control, and multi-user support.

Poor performance for complex queries or large datasets.

Any structural change requires editing the entire file.

Relational Databases

Require more resources (hardware and software).

Need skilled administrators and careful design.

More costly to set up and maintain than flat files.

Less suitable for extremely large unstructured data.

Roles in a Database System

1. System Analyst

Studies the business requirements and understands what the organization needs from the database system.

-Communicates with stakeholders, users, and managers to gather requirements.

-Creates system specifications, workflow diagrams, and functional requirements.

-Ensures that the database system will support the organization’s goals and solve the intended problems.

2. Database Designer

-Translates the system requirements into a logical and physical database design.

-Defines tables, relationships, constraints, keys, and data flows.

-Ensures the database structure is efficient, normalized, and able to handle current and future needs.

-Works closely with analysts and developers to ensure correct implementation.

3. Database Developer

-Implements the database design by creating tables, views, triggers, functions, stored procedures, and queries.

-Writes SQL code to manage data operations.

-Optimizes database performance by improving queries and indexing.

-Ensures the database supports application requirements.

4. DBA (Database Administrator)

-Responsible for day-to-day database operations and management.

-Installs, configures, and upgrades database software.

-Manages backup and recovery, security permissions, user accounts, and performance tuning.

-Monitors the database to ensure high availability and reliability.

-Handles troubleshooting, maintenance, and disaster recovery planning.

5. Application Developer

-Builds the front-end or back-end applications that interact with the database.

-Uses programming languages (such as Java, C#, Python, or web frameworks) to create user interfaces and logic.

-Sends queries to the database using APIs or ORM tools.

-Ensures the application retrieves, displays, updates, and processes data correctly.

6. BI (Business Intelligence) Developer

-Creates dashboards, reports, and analytical tools to help organizations make data-driven decisions.

-Works with data warehouses, ETL processes, and analytical databases.

-Designs data models for reporting and forecasting.

-Uses BI tools (Power BI, Tableau, SSIS, SSRS, etc.) to transform raw data into insights.

-Helps businesses understand trends, performance, and opportunities.
