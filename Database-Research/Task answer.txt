Comparison Between Flat File Systems and Relational Databases

1. Structure

Flat File Systems

Store data in a single file or simple files like TXT, CSV, or spreadsheets.

Data is arranged in lines or rows without enforced structure.

No concept of tables, schemas, or data types.

All information is kept together, making the format simple but limited.

Relational Databases

Organize data into multiple structured tables with rows and columns.

Each table has a defined schema (data types, constraints, rules).

Support indexing, keys, and efficient data retrieval.

Provide a well-organized and controlled environment for storing complex datasets.

2. Data Redundancy

Flat File Systems

High redundancy because the same data must be repeated in multiple entries.

Leads to larger file sizes and more storage usage.

Increases risk of inconsistent data when updates are not applied everywhere.

Relational Databases

Low redundancy due to normalization (splitting data into related tables).

Shared data is stored once and referenced using keys.

Easier to maintain accuracy and consistency across the system.

3. Relationships

Flat File Systems

Cannot naturally represent complex relationships between data.

All data is stored linearly, making linking records difficult.

Relationships must be manually managed, increasing errors.

Relational Databases

Designed to handle relationships using primary keys and foreign keys.

Support one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.

Maintain data integrity automatically through constraints.

4. Example Usage

Flat File Systems

Used for small or simple datasets.

Common in configuration files, logs, simple contact lists, and basic data exchange.

Suitable when the dataset does not require complex queries.

Relational Databases

Used in large, structured, and multi-user applications.

Examples: hospital systems, banking systems, e-commerce platforms, reservation systems.

Ideal for environments requiring high accuracy, quick searches, and secure storage.

5. Drawbacks

Flat File Systems

Difficult to manage as data grows.

Lack security, access control, and multi-user support.

Poor performance for complex queries or large datasets.

Any structural change requires editing the entire file.

Relational Databases

Require more resources (hardware and software).

Need skilled administrators and careful design.

More costly to set up and maintain than flat files.

Less suitable for extremely large unstructured data.
